# lestrange

A playground for dark magic with Java class loaders. This is a work in progress. Currently uses reflection to invoke methods. 

This library is an attempt to understand how dynamic class loaders work and how in languages like Clojure, code is evaluated.

# Usage

Start the server with:
```bash
mvn clean install exec:java
```

Send a class file to be executed:
```bash
curl -XPOST "localhost:8080/loadclass/?classname=SystemInfo&methodname=info" -F "file=@SystemInfo.class"
curl -XPOST "localhost:8080/loadclass/?classname=RandomNumber&methodname=sayHello" -F "file=@RandomNumber.class"
```

# Generating class files
Ensure that clases are public and the method being accessed is public.
```bash
cd utils
javac RandomNumber.java
javac HelloClass.java
javac SystemInfo.java
```
