# lestrange

A playground for dark magic with Java class loaders. This is a work in progress. Currently uses reflection to invoke methods.

This library is an attempt to understand how dynamic class loaders work and how in languages like Clojure, code is evaluated.

# Usage

Start the server with:
```bash
mvn clean install exec:java
```

Send a class file to be executed:
```bash
curl -XPOST "localhost:8080/loadclass/?classname=SystemInfo&methodname=info" -F "file=@SystemInfo.class"
curl -XPOST "localhost:8080/loadclass/?classname=RandomNumber&methodname=sayHello" -F "file=@RandomNumber.class"
```

# Generating class files
Ensure that clases are public and the method being accessed is public.
```bash
cd utils
javac RandomNumber.java
javac HelloClass.java
javac SystemInfo.java
```

# Notes

## Is it okay to create a new class loader every time?
We are creating a new classloader for any class passed to the
/loadclass route. We do this because if we don't, then it is
impossible to reload a class that is already loaded.

This will not cause a memory leak because we are not holding on to any
object of the classes, which therefore can be garbage collected, and
once that happens, no object will reference the classloader, which can
also be garbage collected. [Recall](https://www.dynatrace.com/resources/ebooks/javabook/class-loader-issues/) that:

> A classloader will be removed by the garbage collector only if nothing else refers to it. All classes hold a reference to their classloader and all objects hold references to their classes.


This can be demonstrated using:
```shell
MAVEN_OPTS="-XX:+PrintGC -Xmx20m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError-XX:+CrashOnOutOfMemoryError" mvn exec:java
```

```shell
while true;
  do
      curl -XPOST "localhost:8080/loadclass/?classname=SystemInfo&methodname=info" -F "file=@SystemInfo.class";
      curl -XPOST "localhost:8080/loadclass/?classname=HelloClass&methodname=sayHello" -F "file=@HelloClass.class";
      curl -XPOST "localhost:8080/loadclass/?classname=RandomNumber&methodname=sayHello" -F "file=@RandomNumber.class";
  done
```

The GC logs will show metaspace cleanup of the form:
```shell
[GC (Metadata GC Threshold)  14670K->12241K(18944K), 0.0041918 secs]
[Full GC (Metadata GC Threshold)  12241K->8766K(18944K), 0.0548479 secs]
[Full GC (Ergonomics)  13400K->7388K(16896K), 0.0567170 secs]
```

Investigating further, we can check the memory performance in Visual
VM. Also, let us stop firing requests and then force a GC via VisualVM
and take a heap dump to confirm none of the classloaders we created on
the fly are remaining.
